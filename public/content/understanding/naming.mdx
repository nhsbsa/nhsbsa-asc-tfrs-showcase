        Ideally names should be agreed by the end of discovery. In our case, it was only in alpha that we understood what the service is for. So this was a good time to think about naming.

        We followed best practice by:

        * carrying out extensive user research
        * developing user needs and clarifying the purpose and scope of the service
        * carrying out a naming workshop with BSA and DHSC colleagues to brainstorm and shortlist possible names (ensuring they're verbs which describe the task that users are carrying out)
        * testing these names with users

        This ensured that the final name used the words that users use and is meaningful to them.

        <ZoomImage alt="Outputs from the service name workshop with BSA and DHSC" small={'../../images/service-naming-workshop.png'} medium={'../../images/service-naming-workshop.png'} />

        We agreed a shortlist of 4 service names at the workshop. These were:

        * Get money back for staff learning and training in adult social care
        * Claim funding to support skills in adult social care
        * Claim for adult social care training and development
        * Get help with adult social care training costs

        We tested these names with 8 participants in the third round of usability testing. Each participant ranked their name preferences and explained why theyâ€™d put them in the order they had.

        ## Results

        In general, participants liked the word 'claim', possibly as it resonated with the extensive use of the word within the prototype. Using the same word in the service name therefore makes sense and fits with users' mental models.

                <TableCell width="50%">Overall, this was seen as too long and the 'get money back' wording was felt to be too informal.</TableCell>

            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>**Claim funding to support skills in adult social care**</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Most participants felt this made it sound like they were claiming for funding in advance rather than for reimbursement following training.</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>**Claim for adult social care training and development**</TableCell>
                <TableCell>This was most people's first choice, as it sounds professional and does 'exactly what it says'.</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>**Get help with adult social care training costs**</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Feedback suggested this was seen as the vaguest wording, with participants unclear what sort of help was being referred to.</TableCell>

        ## Recommendation
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        The TFRS delivery team therefore recommended going into beta with the provisional service name of '**Claim for adult social care training and development**'.

        This name is currently going through the approval process within BSA and DHSC.
