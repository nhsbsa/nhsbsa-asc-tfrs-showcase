        ## The problem
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        The government wants to upskill and support the adult social care workforce by paying for training and development activities. But it is currently harder than it could be for adult social care providers to claim back the costs of training and development.

        We worked extensively with DHSC colleagues at the start of alpha to define our problem and opportunity statement. This is what we agreed.

        ### Problem statement

        How might we make it easier for people working in adult social care to access, take up, and complete relevant training and development opportunities?

        ### Opportunity statement

        Staff, both registered and unregistered, who work in adult social care services in England undertake training to carry out their roles effectively and provide high quality care.

        The costs of training are one of the blockers that can discourage staff from engaging with it and employers from prioritising it.

        As part of SR21, its commitment to invest in learning and development, and to encourage uptake of training, the government has set up an adult social care training fund. There is an opportunity to improve access to training by creating a service which allows employers to claim reimbursement from this fund. This could encourage greater collaboration between staff and employers in identifying and meeting training and development opportunities.

        ## Summary of main challenges
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        1. Current schemes are underused. The main current reimbursement scheme - the Workforce Development Fund - is underused and many providers (especially smaller ones) feel it is not worth their while to engage with.
        2. Staff such as careworkers who are not registered with a professional body can feel undervalued compared to registered colleagues like nurses.
        3. Smaller care providers can struggle to fund staff to do longer and more expensive courses as cashflow can be a problem.
        4. For providers with less administrative support, making time to submit and manage reimbursement claims can be challenging and off-putting.

        ## What have we done about it?
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

    Following the government's decision, as part of the adult social care system reform plans, to introduce a new reimbursement scheme, NHSBSA has been exploring approaches to deliver this in the best way to support users.

    Some of the things we have looked at include:

    * making it easier for providers to claim back costs directly, rather than needing to apply through a partnership where it could be unclear what would be funded
    * looking at how we can encourage adult social care staff to complete additional training over and above what they would have done anyway
    * the impact of providers who run most or all of their training in house, rather than buying it in from external providers
    * how we can minimise the requirements around providing the necessary evidence to support claims
    * what we can do to make it easier for internal NHSBSA staff to process and approve claims so that providers can get the money back for training as quickly as possible
