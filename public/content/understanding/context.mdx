        ## Context
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        The adult social care (ASC) market is precarious, with many providers exiting the marketplace each year due to poor returns on investment or the challenge of maintaining commercial viability. It also faces workforce challenges around recruitment and retention due to:

        - poor pay and conditions
        - unclear career structures through training and qualifications
        - perceived low status

        The primary route in England by which government funds ASC training and qualifications has been through the Workforce Development Fund (WDF). This is a scheme designed, built and administered by the charity Skills for Care (SfC) under a direct grant arrangement to SfC from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).

        Employer Led Partnerships (ELP) are used in some areas to submit claims on behalf of other ASC providers.

        The WDF is long established (over 10 years) within the ASC marketplace as the route by which costs can be recovered by providers for the learning and development of their care workers. In recent years the value of the grant has been in the region of £11m per financial year. DHSC is winding down WDF and it will close by March 2025.

        SfC operates under a commercial contract with DHSC. It supplies sector data to DHSC through the Adult Social Care Workforce Data Set (ASC-WDS), which providers must keep up to date in order to get reimbursement from the WDF.

    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        The government is committed to reforming ASC across England, and its 10-year vision, outlined within the [People at the Heart of Care](/uri "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/people-at-the-heart-of-care-adult-social-care-reform-white-paper") white paper (first published in December 21) sets out the long-term reform aspirations. 

        Part of that is to equip the ASC workforce with significantly more of the right training and qualifications to provide better care to end users, whilst recognising the value of ASC workers and providing them with enhanced opportunity for career progression. 

        As a successor to the WDF, DHSC is planning to launch a new Targeted Fund for Learning and Development (TFLD). This will make available, from April 24 to March 25, £137m of grant subsidy to be invested into the ASC sector for eligible training and qualifications. TFLD and WDF will run in parallel for a short time. From April 2024 all new funding will be through through the TFLD.

        DHSC has commissioned NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) to design, build, and administer a Training Funds Reimbursement Service (TFRS) to process all claims from the TFLD and, it is hoped, from other similar initiatives that may follow within the 10-year plan.

        TFLD will directly provide grant subsidy to ASC providers from the DHSC. NHSBSA will administrate payments but are not party to any grant subsidy agreements. This is a demand-led fund on a scale far surpassing that of the WDF. Any modelled forecasts of features such as claim volumes, courses funded and demand profiles are based on best direct or proxy evidence but these are largely extrapolations or projections and should be treated as indicative rather than predictive.

        ## Types of funding
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

       There are 2 funding pots within the TFRS.

        Targeted upskilling - to support the provision of training and qualifications to non-registered care workers, as well as registered and aspiring managers.

        CPD (continuing professional development) - to support professional revalidation for staff registered with a professional body such as the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

       Here’s how the WDF currently works at a high level.

        #### 1. Publicity

        Skills for Care publicises the WDF using a variety of methods, including direct contact to ASC providers and via employer-led partnerships (ELPs).

        #### 2. Announcement

        The amount of funding for the next year, and the types of learning that will be eligible, is announced by Skills for Care.

        #### 3. Interest

        An ASC provider decides they would like to apply for funding. Depending on their location, this could be through their local ELP or direct with Skills for Care.

        #### 4. Eligibility

        While the eligibility rules in theory are the same regardless of route, there may be variations in how they're applied. Providers will need to:
        - directly employ paid care staff
        - have an up to date account with the ASC workforce dataset (ASC-WDS)
        - complete a declaration form
        - submit evidence of their need for funding and to support their claims for reimbursement

        #### 5. Acceptance or rejection

        Providers may be rejected after expressing interest in the fund, for example if it's oversubscribed. If they're accepted, they'll sign a contract with Skills for Care with milestones they'll need to meet, for example deadlines for making claims.

        #### 6. Submission

        Once contracts are agreed, providers can start to submit claims. These must be retrospective and include evidence that training has been completed. If a provider is part of an ELP, claims will be made through the lead partner, who will check ongoing eligibility. This is mainly around whether the provider's ASC-WDS account is up to date, which is a significant challenge and blocker for some providers.

        #### 7. Processing

        Once claims are validated by the ELP, they will be passed on to Skills for Care to process. This might happen individually or in bulk, though the aim will be to not delay payments getting to providers.

        #### 8. Payment

        If successful, reimbursement is made to the provider. If the claim was made through an ELP then funds will go via the ELP, who will be responsible for forwarding them on.
