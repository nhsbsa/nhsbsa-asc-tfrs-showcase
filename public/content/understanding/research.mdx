        ## Research recruitment
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Recognising the significant challenges of workload within the adult social care (ASC) sector, user researchers felt that it may be more difficult to recruit users in this sector than in other careers. User researchers therefore began working on recruitment early on in the Alpha phase in order to identify and recruit users for testing.

        * In total, 34 participants were recruited.
        * There were 34 individual interviews and one co-design session with five participants.
        * Four participants were interviewed twice in different rounds of research.

        ### Methods of recruitment

        #### Care providers

        We used the CQC’s online list of care homes to find the names of care homes across the UK. Using these names, we researched a contact form and/or email online for care homes online. In total:

        * 713 care homes were researched
        * 374 of these had valid email addresses
        * 802 emails were sent to these care homes over a period of three months

        #### Stakeholder and advocacy organisations

        We collaborated with many stakeholder and advocacy organisations across the UK to recruit research participants.

        ##### Working with BSA Research Ops

        11 contacts were identified and contacted through the BSA

        ##### Employer-Led Partnerships

        29 contacts were identified and contacted

        ##### Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) contacts

        Colleagues in DHSC were shared our research with the following organisations on three occasions

        ##### Snowball and personal recruitment

        * After each user research session, all participants were asked whether they could recommend a colleague or friend.
        * We also asked several internal BSA colleagues to test the prototype, based on their experiences in the care sector.
        * We also identified personal contacts of the team in the care sector.

        ## Planning and conducting research
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        We planned and conducted four rounds of research.

        ### Round One - Discovery

        #### Research aims

        To learn more about our users, we conducted semi-structured interviews with participants working in the ASC sector.

        <InsetText>
            * To identify the users in care providers who are most likely to be responsible for completing claims
            * To find out how care providers provide, pay for and record staff training, and whether this differs by organisation size
            * To find out how care providers manage payments for training, and whether this differs by organisation size
            * To find out how training provision and attendance may vary according to staff type
            * To find out how actively care staff are involved in managing their own training and CPD
            * To find out how care providers establish that training has been completed
            * To find out whether care provider administrators and carers heard about the training reimbursement scheme
        </InsetText>

        #### Conducting the research

        ##### Interviews

        We spoke to 10 people in semi-structured interviews as part of this first round of user research.

        * 8 of these sessions were conducted over MS Teams. 2 sessions were face-to-face in a care home.
        * The Teams calls were 45-60 minutes long and included:
        * A short introduction to the participant and their role
            * Discussion of how learning and development is managed
            * Discussion of administrative processes relating to learning and development
            * Discussion of their experience of the WDF and ASC-WDS, how they record proof of completion and track all the training / qualifications held by their staff.

        ##### Co-design workshop

        We conducted a co-design workshop with six participants from a national care provider. This allowed to hear a variety of thoughts and opinions in a collaborative setting.

        ##### Analysis

        Notes were taken on Miro during each session and analysed using affinity mapping by user researchers with input from the wider team.

        ### Round Two - Usability testing

        #### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test the first iteration of our prototype and the user journey through the service
            * To test some of the terminology used, such as “claim items”, “learners” and “L&D activity”
            * To validate some of our findings from the mini-discovery, particularly around our users' mental models and how they would expect a service like this to operate
        </InsetText>

        #### Conducting the research

        ##### Interviews

        * We spoke to 5 people as part of this round of user research.
        * All of these sessions were conducted over MS Teams.
        * The Teams calls were 45-60 minutes and included:
            * A short introduction to the participant and their role
            * A test of the prototype by users and request for feedback

        ##### Analysis

        Notes were taken on Miro during each session and analysed using affinity mapping by user researchers and the wider team.

        ### Round Three - Usability Testing

        #### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test the second iteration of our prototype and the user journey through the service
            * To understand whether changes to the user journey were consistent with users' mental models
        </InsetText>

        #### Conducting the research

        ##### Interviews

        * We spoke to 5 people as part of this round of user research.
        * All of these sessions were conducted over MS Teams.
        * The Teams calls were 45-60 minutes and included:
            * A short introduction to the participant and their role
            * Completion of a task using the prototype by users
            * Discussion of the overall scenario and service
        * In advance of the testing, we shared a scenario with the users to read, in order to test specific elements of the service. This scenario asked them to start a new claim for a course that four members of staff had attended.

        ##### Analysis

        Notes were taken on Miro by various team members during each research session. These notes later formed the basis of our analysis.

        ### Round Four - Usability Testing

        #### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test whether users found an updated version of the prototype more intuitive to use, following prototype revisions
            * To interrogate the new 'claim scaffold' approach ability to add learners onto the system.
            * To test the updated ability to add learners onto the system
            * To get feedback on the service name, based on four options
        </InsetText>

        #### Conducting the research

        ##### Interviews

        * We spoke to 8 people as part of this round of user research.
        * All of these sessions were conducted over MS Teams.
        * The Teams calls were 45-60 minutes and included:
            * A short introduction to the participant and their role
            * A test of the prototype by users
            * A discussion of their wider feedback on the service
            * Showing the user four potential names for the service and asking for their feedback
        * In advance of the testing, we shared a scenario with the users to read, in order to test specific elements of the service. 
            * Task one asked them to start a new claim for a course that four members of staff had attended. Three learners already existed in the service, and one needed to be added.
            * Task two asked them to find an existing claim using the claim ID, and add a new learner to this claim.
            * Task three asked them to identify whether two previously submitted claims had been paid, with limited details about each claim and no claim ID.

        ##### Analysis

        Notes were taken on Miro by various team members during each research session. These notes later formed the basis of our analysis.
