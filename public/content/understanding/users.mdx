            Using findings and analysis from user research, we have explored our users' needs and attitudes towards the service. We have presented these as user needs and mindsets, ensuring that we keep these at the forefront of all aspects of design.

        ### User need 1
        As a submitter, I need to be able to manage (or switch between) CPD and TU claims so that I can submit claims efficiently.

        ### User need 2
        As a submitter, I need to be able to save my progress so that I can return to it later (for example when I have proof of completion).

        ### User need 3
        As a submitter, I need to easily upload claim evidence without the need to duplicate/resubmit so that I don't waste time and can focus on my most important duties.

        ### User need 4
        As an ASC provider, I need clear, easy-to-follow guidance so that I can understand who/what is eligible, what to submit and when, and know when I will receive reimbursement.

        ### User need 5
        As an ASC provider, I need flexibility in who can start, edit, or submit a claim for my organization so that I don't have to worry about effort being lost due to unplanned work absence.

        ### User need 6
        As an ASC provider, I need to see what we've already claimed for and how much budget we have left so that we can claim all the money that we are eligible for.

        ### User need 7
        As a small ASC provider, I need to see approximately when we can expect to be paid so that I am able to manage my budget effectively.

        ### User need 8
        As a large ASC provider, I need a way to uniquely identify learners in the service when I may not have unique identifiers myself (e.g., no HR system) so that I don't claim for the wrong learner (e.g., two people with the same name).
