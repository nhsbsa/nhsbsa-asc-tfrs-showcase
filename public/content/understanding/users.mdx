            Using findings and analysis from user research, we have explored our users' needs and attitudes towards the service. We have presented these as user needs and personas, ensuring that we keep these at the forefront of all aspects of design.

        ## Our users
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
    At the highest level we have divided our users into two distinct groups:
    - **Submitters** - these are the individuals who will be using our service to submit claims for reimbursement. In smaller providers, this will often be the sole general administrator, for whom this is simply one task for them to complete alongside many others. In larger organisations, this will likely be someone working within a dedicated Learning and Development (L&D) team, who is quite experienced completing tasks like this and may well have considerable experience using schemes like the Workforce Development Fund (WDF).
    - **Processors** - these are the internal operational NHS BSA staff who will be receiving the claims submitted by the Submitters, verifying the details, and assuming everything is in order, processing the payment. 
    
    During the Alpha phase we have conducted research with both sets of users, although our focus has been primarily on the Submitters. 
    
    We have also discussed a third group - **Learners**. These are individuals who will themselves actually be attending the training, doing the revalidation activities, etc. However as they will not be directly interacting with the service we have not prioritised research with this group.

        ## User needs
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        After our mini-discovery we created a set of high-level user needs. These have subsequently been revised to reflect what we have observed throughout our three rounds of usability testing.
        
        ### User need 1
        As a submitter, I need to be able to manage (or switch between) CPD and TU claims so that I can submit claims efficiently.

        ### User need 2
        As a submitter, I need to be able to save my progress so that I can return to it later (for example when I have proof of completion).

        ### User need 3
        As a submitter, I need to easily upload claim evidence without the need to duplicate/resubmit so that I don't waste time and can focus on my most important duties.

        ### User need 4
        As an ASC provider, I need clear, easy-to-follow guidance so that I can understand who/what is eligible, what to submit and when, and know when I will receive reimbursement.

        ### User need 5
        As an ASC provider, I need flexibility in who can start, edit, or submit a claim for my organization so that I don't have to worry about effort being lost due to unplanned work absence.

        ### User need 6
        As an ASC provider, I need to see what we've already claimed for and how much budget we have left so that we can claim all the money that we are eligible for.

        ### User need 7
        As a small ASC provider, I need to see approximately when we can expect to be paid so that I am able to manage my budget effectively.

        ### User need 8
        As a large ASC provider, I need a way to uniquely identify learners in the service when I may not have unique identifiers myself (e.g., no HR system) so that I don't claim for the wrong learner (e.g., two people with the same name).

        ## Personas
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        We have developed personas to represent our users and their unique challenges. After lengthy consideration we felt that personas, rather than mindsets, were the most appropriate tool for representing the needs, behaviours and attitudes of our users. In particular we felt it necessary to capture the ways in which the challenges faced by Submitters in smaller organisations were markedly different from those faced in larger organisations.

        ### Persona 1

        ### Persona 2
        <ZoomImage alt="Persona 2: An administrator in a medium-sized care provider." small={'../../images/persona-2.png'} medium={'../../images/persona-2.png'} />

        ### Persona 3
