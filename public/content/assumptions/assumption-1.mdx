        A single caregiver may undergo different types of training to cater to the diverse needs of the people they assist. For instance, a nurse might pursue advanced clinical courses, while a support worker may focus on communication and empathy training. As a result, the reimbursement claims could consist of expenses incurred for a combination of specialised and generalised training modules.

        However, it's also plausible that some care home staff may opt for a more concentrated approach, investing in single courses that delve into a specific aspect of their profession. This might be especially true for individuals seeking expertise in a particular field. Reimbursement claims may include expenses related to training sessions that contribute significantly to the individual's professional development.

    From our research we know that there can be a blend of training for care workers and that claims must cater for a certain amount of complexity.
