        At the beginning of our alpha we ran a workshop to [document and map our assumptions](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMhNCsmw=/?share_link_id=855651440063) (Miro password: bsaasc123) and map them to understand which ones were riskiest.

        As we progressed and learned more about our potential service and the constraints we had, we [revisited and iterated](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMhNCsmw=/?moveToWidget=3458764565018791068&cot=1) (Miro password: bsaasc123) our earlier assumptions to make sure they were still relevant and still valid.

        <InsetText>
        The assumptions fell into 3 core areas around:

        - **policy** — the description and constraints around TFRS, and how we understood these to be able to design the service
        - **governance** — the internal NHSBSA governance of the service, for instance around counter fraud
        - **user behaviour** — how both external and internal users would behave and their expectations of the service
        </InsetText>
        
        ## Policy

        Our initial assumption was that the policy around TFRS was in a suitable position for us to start making design decisions on. We realised early in alpha, however, that the service commission document - which described the policy - was still being worked on. This had huge implications for us, as time constraints meant we needed to start design work as early as possible. We therefore set up daily meetings with DHSC policy colleagues to identify and address areas where the service commission was vague or ambiguous. 

        This helped us to create a positive, constructive relationship with policy and quickly get to a point where we had the necessary clarity to start the design of the service. Without this effort, we would be taking on huge amounts of policy debt into beta.

        ## Governance

        We had assumed that thinking around governance issues, such as evidence, identity checks and fraud protection measures, would have been taken forward by our solution architect (SA). Unfortunately, though, we lost our SA in early alpha and this role was not replaced for some time. This led to a considerable gap in terms of thinking through these governance issues. We had made design decisions early on, without the input of an SA, that we had to pivot on later.
        
        For example, our prototype assumed that we would be able to get back information from internal NHSBSA systems around the payment status of claims. We later found, however, that this would be much more challenging than expected and might not be possible, at least for private beta.
        
        ## User behaviour


        Our service will have 2 types of users - external users from ASC providers who’ll be submitting claims, and internal NHSBSA users who’ll be processing them. During alpha, we prioritised external users, as the submission journey is much riskier from a design perspective. Of the assumptions around the behaviour of these external users, we focussed on:

        - **Assumption 1** — Submitters will submit claims, that include a mixture of multiple courses or single courses per training recipient

        - **Assumption 2** — Users of the service will be time poor

        - **Assumption 3** — Submitters will be tech savvy

        - **Assumption 4** — (Our users) are digitally confident

        These are where we believed we could provide the most value to our users and lay a foundation for testing the other assumptions at a later date. The others are not any less important but without the work we undertook, it would not have made sense to continue testing them.

        For example, other assumptions covered the reporting needs for submitters and organisations. If we had focussed on these without first understanding what data the service asks for, we may have prototyped and tested designs which are not feasible.
