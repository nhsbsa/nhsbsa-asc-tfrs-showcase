        At the beginning of our alpha we took part in a workshop to document our assumptions and map them to understand which ones were riskiest. This artefact is [available here](/uri "https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMhNCsmw=/?moveToWidget=3458764565018666749&cot=14") (password: bsaasc123).

        As we progressed and learned more about our potential service and the constraints we had, we revisited our earlier assumptions to make sure they were still relevant and still valid. We iterated the assumptions and grouped them. This work is [available here](/uri "https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMhNCsmw=/?moveToWidget=3458764565018791068&cot=14"). 

        Some of the assumptions we had earlier on — mainly around policy and external processes — we downgraded in priority. These were still valid assumptions, however, we had little control over how much we could influence them. We also took the iteration to prioritise where we believed we could deliver the most value to users.

        Of the assumptions, we prioritised on the following;

        - **Assumption 1** — Submitters will submit claims, that include a mixture of multiple courses or single courses per training recipient

        - **Assumption 2** — Users of the service will be time poor

        - **Assumption 3** — Submitters will be tech savvy

        - **Assumption 4** — (Our users) are digitally confident

        The above is where we believed we could provide the most value to our users, and lay a foundation for testing the other assumptions at a later date. The others are not any less important, but without the work we undertook, it would not have made sense to continue testing them.

        For example, assumptions 5 and 6 cover the reporting needs for submitters and organisations. If we had focussed on these without first understanding what data the service asks for, we may have prototyped and tested for something that isn’t feasible.
