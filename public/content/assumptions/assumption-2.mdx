    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Social care workers often find themselves grappling with the challenges of being time poor, overworked, and part of understaffed teams within the demanding field of social care. The nature of their profession entails providing crucial support to vulnerable individuals, including the elderly, disabled, or those facing mental health challenges. 

        One of the primary factors contributing to the time poverty of social care workers is the sheer volume and complexity of their responsibilities. The paperwork and administrative tasks associated with documenting client progress and ensuring compliance with regulations further compound the time pressures faced by social care professionals.

        The issue of being overworked is exacerbated by the emotional toll of the job. The need for empathetic and personalised care often requires additional time, which, in turn, contributes to their workload.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        With research showing us that staff are time poor due to being overworked and understaffed, we must be careful we do not add to these pressures by creating an overly complex service or one that does not meet the needs of our users.

        Care staff do wish to undergo training and development, but adding a layer of difficulty in claiming reimbursement may dissuade staff from searching for these opportunities.
