        <LeadParagraph>As we prepare for beta, we've been exploring how we could use data to monitor our performance. We aim to have a performance framework with measures that will enable us to understand if we're meeting user needs and outcomes, and are effectively supporting users through the training fund reimbursement service (TFRS).</LeadParagraph>

        ## Approach
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        We are undertaking several workshops to map user needs against our vision and goals, prioritise these, and identify success and failure indicators against the key goals identified for the TFRS, which has formed our initial Performance Framework.

        ## Our vision
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        To upskill, retain and grow the ASC workforce by making it easy for employers to claim the costs back of training and development, including professional revalidation

        ## Priority goals
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        * To make it easy to track the progress of submitted claims
        * ASC providers will be able to self-serve and submit training reimbursement claims online easily with little to no support
        * Make it easy to find information and guidance relating to the scheme, what it covers, and how it works
        * Deliver a service that is secure to use and always available

        ## KPI metrics
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Outside of the 4 core GDS KPIs (Digital uptake, Completion rate, Cost per transaction, User satisfaction), we will also be looking to track several other metrics to track the performance and success of our service:

        * Numbers of employers completing TFRS claims
        * Completed digital transactions of submitted claims
        * Completions for split payment qualifications - attrition rates for each fund (CPD, TU)
        * TFRS application hits, scheme guidance hits by total volumetric made up of unique URLs
        * System availability - track the service uptime and allowable downtime
        * Measuring the cost-efficiency of the service to identify opportunities to become more cost-efficient
        * User satisfaction - gather survey feedback on satisfaction with the service
        * Repeated contact to call centre (number of contacts in dynamics) vs applications
        * Analytics on kick-out screens compared to successful completions
        * Volume of declined and then re-submitted claims
