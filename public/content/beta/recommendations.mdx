        ### Pragmatic decisions should be made about how to provide the most early value in private beta from both a user and policy perspective
        
        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            The GDS approach to service development emphasises the need to make pragmatic, and sometimes difficult, decisions about the minimum viable product (MVP). Without such decisions, scope creep can easily mean that the product launched to users is trying to do too much and therefore suffers in terms of both design and build quality.

            There is also the challenge of business requirements which might be at odds with user needs. For example, the requirement for employers to have an up to date ASC-WDS account is a barrier rather than an enabler to users of our service.

            We recommend working with NHSBSA and DHSC to ensure that we are confident from a policy, design, technology and user perspective in the decisions around the shape of the MVP. We also think it would be sensible to explore alternatives to ASC-WDS compliance, even if just for private beta.

        ### For future projects it would be worth looking at how project phases and teams are set up to better bridge the gaps we experienced on TFRS

        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            While the discovery that fed into our alpha delivery was incredibly thorough, it was not at the level of detail we needed in order to start alpha with a strong understanding of the service we were tasked to deliver. This was because the discovery was at a more strategic level, looking at how to meet the government's objectives around supporting and retaining the adult social care workforce. It barely touched on the possibility of reimbursement for training and development activities, meaning that we had to carry out our own mini discovery before starting alpha proper. It also led to challenges in agreeing a problem statement for alpha, as stakeholder expectations were set by the high level discovery.

            We recommend ensuring that discoveries always directly relate - at the right level of granularity - to the specific problem that the alpha will be expected to address. We also suggest that to maintain knowledge and expertise, there could be better handovers between teams carrying out different phases of delivery.

        ### Developing policy more iteratively, collaboratively and using a human centred approach could de-risk project delivery
        
        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            A significant challenge on the TFRS alpha has been getting to a position where policy around the funding scheme is sufficiently detailed and non-ambiguous to be able to design the reimbursement service. We know how much work has been put into policy design but also how challenging this has been in terms of timescales and changing policy personel.

            We recommend moving to a human centred approach to policy design. Just as no government department would ever ask a delivery team to create a digital service that wasn't based on user centred design, in future we expect that policy will be created in a similar way. There is ample precedent for this across other departments (such as the Ministry of Justice). Involving users would ensure that policy works in practice as well as on paper, would spot inconsistencies, ensure that terminology is appropriate and make the design and development of the digital service easier and quicker.

            It's also important to include NHSBSA as the delivery partner more closely in policy development, for similar reasons. A more iterative, collaborate approach would lead to better policy in shorter timescales.

        ### Time and money should be set aside in early beta to focus on creating an accessible and inclusive service
        
        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            Recruitment challenges and time pressures meant we could not focus as much as we wanted to on accessibility during alpha, though obviously our prototype is built using GDS accessible patterns and components.

            We recommend that we carry out a range of activities in early beta to ensure that not just the digital service itself is fully accessible but that we take a wider approach to accessibility and inclusivity to really ensure that everyone can access the reimbursement service in whatever form they need to.

            Actions could include:

            * accessibility audits (internal or externally commissioned)
            * testing with proxy users (people outside of adult social care but who have accessibility needs)
            * heuristic testing
            * developing a standard NHSBSA approach to accessibility
        </Details>

        <Tag text="Recommendation 5" colour="green" />
        ### It's important to focus strategically as well as tactically when delivering services to understand the wider landscape and the best ways of aligning services and approaches
        
        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            When timescales are short, it's easy to focus more tactically on developing a solution quickly to meet the policy commitments and constraints. But this can be shortsighted and lead to missed opportunities and synergies.

            For example, TFRS is currently closely aligned to the ASC-WDS when there might be other services that would be a good (or better) fit with. The upcoming adult social care skills passport, for instance, clearly has a lot in common with TFRS.

            We recommend that NHSBSA and DHSC look broadly at the direction of travel for TFRS, those services it could learn from as well as those it could inform, and if it's not already happening to commision service design work across the whole adult social care area to ensure that the services in this space are aligned, consistent and co-ordinated.

        ### We should make sure we're not losing anything important when transitioning from WDF to TFRS
        
        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            There might be unintended consequences of moving from the Workforce Development Fund (WDF) to TFRS which would benefit from being explored further. For example, we have heard from many research participants about how Skills for Care provides a 'one stop shop', meaning that they can answer general questions about training as well as specific queries about reimbursement. WDF is also based on a partnership model, where lead organisations within a partnership provide advice and support around reimbursement to other (particularly smaller) employers.

            Once lost, these aspects of the WDF could be hard to bring back and it's currently unknown how much of an issue this would be. We recommend carrying out a full gap analysis between the WDF and TFRS in early beta, as well as research with employers, to explore this more fully.

        ### Further research would be useful into the types of training covered by TFRS and the impact on both ASC employers and on the aims of the fund if things like internal training are not included
        
        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            We've heard over and over in UR sessions that many adult social care employers, including but not limited to the largest organisations, run most of their training internally and have very little need to go out to external training providers. This does not fit well with the TFRS model, which requires employers to buy training from an approved list in order to get reimbursement.

            While it's possible that employers will change their approach, or consider additional training over and above what they provide at the moment, these are assumptions that need exploring. We also know that employers often feel unwilling to disband or reduce in size their current internal training teams as they would be hard be re-constitute if the reimbursement fund changes or disappears in the future.

            We therefore recommend carrying out research in early beta to explore the impact on the types of training currently in and out of scope for TFRS and whether policy might need to change in order to maximise benefits from the scheme.

        ### Recruitment for UR sessions is extremely challenging and a piece of work across NHSBSA and DHSC to identify effective future approaches would be useful
        
        <Details title={'Read more'}>
            Despite huge efforts within the team and stalwart help from NHSBSA research operations and from DHSC, finding participants for our user research has been one of the main blockers during alpha. We know from talking to other teams that this seems to be a common issue within adult social care. We recommend NHSBSA and DHSC working together on an adult social care UR recruitment toolkit to make it easier for projects in this policy space.

            Areas worth looking at include:

            * the use of recruitment agencies
            * more flexibility around the role of social media to advertise recruitment
            * allowing greater lead-in time (for example, starting recruitment for alpha prior to the end of discovery)
            * increasing incentives when to individuals and employers
            * increasing the size and scope of participant panels
