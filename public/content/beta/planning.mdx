        The team have been organically working towards Beta by validating and investigating user needs and technical options as we've progressed sprint by sprint.

        In sprint 8 we came together as a team for several beta planning workshops. We managed to group features within the service map to understand what features and functionality were Now (MVP for June), Next (ready for public beta), and Later (ready for live). Several factors played a part in how priority decisions were made, specifically;
        - Constraints around the fixed deadline of June 2024 for when the service needs to be processing transactions in private beta
        - How best functionality meets the needs of our users
        - Value and outcomes versus effort involved
        - Utilising existing systems and processes of similar services already being run within NHSBSA

        * A mix of adult social care providers of both size and learning activities.
        * Align as closely as possible with policy rollout and communication.
        * Staged roll-out starting with organisation onboarding and claim submissions.
        * Align with the roll-out of supporting services in the adult social care sector such as the Care Workforce Pathway and Digital Passport.

    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Moving into beta we’ve secured a budget for the financial year 24/25 to scale up the team to ensure we have the right mix of roles and skills, understandably the biggest area being development team members as we move into building out the service. Outside of the existing alpha team that will also be moving through to beta, we will be introducing;
        - Product Owner
        - UX Designer
        - Developer Delivery Manager 
        - Business Analyst 
        - 3 DevOps Engineer 
        - 8 Software Developers 
        - 4 Performance and Test Engineers

        The communications to the ASC sector around this new service will be as important as the service itself. If people don’t know about the service, they won’t be able to make use of the fund.

        DHSC will be responsible for overall awareness. They have already developed a draft comms plan and set up a weekly joint comms meeting with NHSBSA, which will include representation from the TFRS delivery team. Involvement of the delivery team will make sure that all messaging going out to the sector around the new service is accurate and aligned with the terminology and guidance within the service itself.

        Communications challenges are likely to include:
        - the transition from WDF to TFRS, as managing expectations when there’s an incumbent service are harder than implementing a new service from scratch
        - the fact that other new services, such as the apprenticeship fund, are being rolled out at the same time as this could cause further confusion for users
        - concern around the broader elements of WDF that will be lost, such as the role of employer-led partnerships (ELPs), and anything we can do to mitigate these

        We recommend segmenting the potential users of the service so that comms can be tailored to their specific needs. For instance, a managing director of an ASC employer who will be signing the grant award declaration on first use of the service will need different information to a learning and development manager who will be submitting claims. Once segmented, we can support the creation of a range of materials such as videos, crib sheets, emails and blogs.

        From experience of other services, an approach to drip feed comms to the sector across multiple channels over an extended period can be more effective than a big bang approach. This ensures that users start to build awareness in an organic and non-rushed way. Expectations can be managed by providing information about timescales and when more detailed guidance will be available. This limits the potential volume of enquiries to DHSC from people worried about the closure of WDF. 

        DHSC has already set up an inbox for enquiries and this has been publicised by Skills for Care. We hope to look at the usage of this to understand early concerns across the sector and what we can do to mitigate these.
