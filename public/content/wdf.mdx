                ### 1. Publicity
                Skills for Care publicises the WDF using a variety of methods, including direct contact to ASC providers and via employer-led partnerships (ELPs).

                <TableCell width="80%">
                ### 2. Announcement
                The amount of funding for the next year, and the types of learning that will be eligible, is announced by Skills for Care.

                <TableCell width="80%">
                ### 3. Interest
                An ASC provider decides they would like to apply for funding. Depending on their location, this could be through their local ELP or direct with Skills for Care.
                </TableCell>

                <TableCell width="80%">
                ### 4. Eligibility
                While the eligibility rules in theory are the same regardless of route, there may be variations in how they're applied. Providers will need to:
                - directly employ paid care staff
                - have an up to date account with the ASC workforce dataset (ASC-WDS)
                - complete a declaration form
                - submit evidence of their need for funding and to support their claims for reimbursement.

                <TableCell width="80%">
                 ### 5. Acceptance or rejection
                Providers may be rejected after expressing interest in the fund, for example if it's oversubscribed. If they're accepted, they'll sign a contract with Skills for Care with milestones they'll need to meet, for example deadlines for making claims.

                <TableCell width="80%">
                ### 6. Submission
                Once contracts are agreed, providers can start to submit claims. These must be retrospective and include evidence that training has been completed. If a provider is part of an ELP, claims will be made through the lead partner, who will check ongoing eligibility. This is mainly around whether the provider's ASC-WDS account is up to date, which is a significant challenge and blocker for some providers.

                <TableCell width="80%">
                ### 7. Processing
                Once claims are validated by the ELP, they will be passed on to Skills for Care to process. This might happen individually or in bulk, though the aim will be to not delay payments getting to providers.

                <TableCell width="80%">
                ### 8. Payment
                If successful, reimbursement is made to the provider. If the claim was made through an ELP then funds will go via the ELP, who will be responsible for forwarding them on.
