            Using findings and analysis from user research, we have explored our users' needs and attitudes towards the service. We have presented these as user needs and personas, ensuring that we keep these at the forefront of all aspects of design.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
    At the highest level we have divided our users into two distinct groups:
    - **Submitters** - these are the individuals who will be using our service to submit claims for reimbursement. In smaller providers, this will often be the sole general administrator, for whom this is simply one task for them to complete alongside many others. In larger organisations, this will likely be someone working within a dedicated Learning and Development (L&D) team, who is quite experienced completing tasks like this and may well have considerable experience using schemes like the Workforce Development Fund (WDF).
    - **Processors** - these are the internal operational NHS BSA staff who will be receiving the claims submitted by the Submitters, verifying the details, and assuming everything is in order, processing the payment. 
    
    During the Alpha phase we have conducted research with both sets of users, although our focus has been primarily on the Submitters. 
    
    We have also discussed a third group - **Learners**. These are individuals who will themselves actually be attending the training, doing the revalidation activities, etc. However as they will not be directly interacting with the service we have not prioritised research with this group.

        ## User needs
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        After our mini-discovery we created a set of high-level user needs. These have subsequently been revised to reflect what we have observed throughout our three rounds of usability testing.

        <Tag text="User need 1" colour="green" />
        ### Switch between CPD and TU claims
        As a submitter, I need to be able to manage (or switch between) CPD and TU claims so that I can submit claims efficiently.

        <Tag text="User need 2" colour="green" />
        ### Save progress
        As a submitter, I need to be able to save my progress so that I can return to it later (for example when I have proof of completion).

        <Tag text="User need 3" colour="green" />
        ### Upload claim evidence
        As a submitter, I need to easily upload claim evidence without the need to duplicate/resubmit so that I don't waste time and can focus on my most important duties.

        <Tag text="User need 4" colour="green" />
        ### Easy-to-follow guidance
        As an ASC provider, I need clear, easy-to-follow guidance so that I can understand who/what is eligible, what to submit and when, and know when I will receive reimbursement.

        <Tag text="User need 5" colour="green" />
        ### Organisational flexibility
        As an ASC provider, I need flexibility in who can start, edit, or submit a claim for my organisation so that I don't have to worry about effort being lost due to unplanned work absence.

        <Tag text="User need 6" colour="green" />
        ### Manage claims and budgets
        As an ASC provider, I need to see what we've already claimed for and how much budget we have left so that we can claim all the money that we are eligible for.

        <Tag text="User need 7" colour="green" />
        ### Anticipate payments
        As a small ASC provider, I need to see approximately when we can expect to be paid so that I am able to manage my budget effectively.

        <Tag text="User need 8" colour="green" />
        ### Uniquely identify learners
        As a large ASC provider, I need a way to uniquely identify learners in the service when I may not have unique identifiers myself (e.g., no HR system) so that I don't claim for the wrong learner (e.g., two people with the same name).

        ## Personas
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        We have developed personas to represent our users and their unique challenges. After lengthy consideration we felt that personas, rather than mindsets, were the most appropriate tool for representing the needs, behaviours and attitudes of our users.
        
        In particular we felt it necessary to capture the ways in which the challenges faced by Submitters in smaller organisations were markedly different from those faced in larger organisations.

                        #### About me
                        I work in a small care provider which provides care services. My organisation usually works in a small environment like a care home for elderly people, but sometimes organisations like mine have multiple sites.

                        I'm the only person who does my role, but sometimes I get helped out by other people

                        #### Attitudes towards learning and development
                        As a small care provider, my organisation often funds our own training, so we have to be careful about sending people on training

                        I don't have a lot of time to spend on onerous administrative processes, so sometimes I avoid making WDF claims to save time, even if I might get extra money back

                        #### Expectations of the service
                        I'm worried that submitting reimbursement claims in a new service might take a long time to do. As we're a small provider, cash flow is important to us, so we need to receive payment quickly

                        I'm familiar with the WDF, but I don't always use it because it's hard to create claims

                        #### Support needs
                        I need support to understand what's eligible, so I can quickly decide whether a claim is viable or not

                        Because it's a small organisation, I often know our learners and training providers quite well, which might make it easier to complete claims. I know where all our evidence is saved, so I won't need much support here

                            I work in a medium-sized care provider which provides care services. Some organisations this size provider multiple types of care, but others focus just on one group, like residential homes for adults with learning disabilities.

                            I work in a small team - it's not just me who provides admin support for L&D. Line managers also help out, by recording and tracking training needs and course attendance.

                            As a medium-sized care provider, my organisation provides internal training, delivered by our own teams. We don't often use external providers, except when we need specialist help. Training is based around the needs of service users.

                            Some organisations like ours use an e-learning platform, especially for mandatory training. We like using this as it makes it easier to ensure training is complete. It's hard to backfill roles when people are away.

                        #### Support needs
                            As we have lots of different teams, local managers identify and track training for their employees, and we collate the results centrally. This means that sometimes we don't always have copies of their evidence.

                            There's a few of us in the team, so it's important for me to see what other claims have been started, and by whom.

                            All our new staff take training when they onboard, so I might need to add multiple people or courses at the same time.

We don't often use external providers, although we do when we need specialist training. Backfilling for training is not usually a big barrier for us, as we're able to move people around as and when needed.

                            We are though keen to get value for money and take advantage of schemes such as this and the WDF. We would look to take advantage as much as possible.

                            - As an ASC provider, I need flexibility in who can start, edit or submit a claim for my organisation, so that I don't have to worry about effort being lost due to unplanned work absence
                            - As an ASC provider. I need to see what we've already claimed for and how much budget we have left, so we can effectively take advantage of the TRFS

                            - As I work as part of an L&D team, I need to be able to start a claim and have a colleague of mine be able to complete it, and vice versa.
                            - I need to be able to clearly differentiate between employees as I might not be familiar with them individually. We have staff members with identical names.
                            - Given the number of staff we deal with, some sort of bulk upload would be very helpful.
                            - I'd like to track how much remaining budget we have left so that we can maximise how much funding we receive each financial year.
