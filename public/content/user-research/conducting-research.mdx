        ### Research aims

        To learn more about our users, we conducted semi-structured interviews with participants working in the ASC sector.

        We also conducted a co-design workshop with six additional participants.

        <InsetText>
            * To identify the users in care providers who are most likely to be responsible for completing claims 
            * To find out how care providers provide, pay for and record staff training, and whether this differs by organisation size
            * To find out how care providers manage payments for training, and whether this differs by organisation size 
            * To find out how training provision and attendance may vary according to staff type
            * To find out how actively care staff are involved in managing their own training and CPD
            * To find out how care providers establish that training has been completed
            * To find out whether care provider administrators and carers heard about the training reimbursement scheme
        </InsetText>


        #### Co-design workshop

        We conducted a co-design workshop with six participants from a national care provider. This allowed to hear a variety of thoughts and opinions in a collaborative setting.

        <InsetText>
            <Details title={'Why we used co-design'}>
                In early alpha we were focussed on understanding the policy space but due to short deadlines and the need to meet ministerial commitments, stakeholders understandably wanted to see quick design outputs. There was a real tension between doing things quickly and doing them properly.

                Several members of the delivery team had experience of co-design, where users are brought into the design process early, before decisions have been made. This is distinct from more standard usability testing, where users are shown an existing prototype to discover how it could be improved.

                Benefits of co-design include:

                * speeding up the creation of an initial prototype
                * de-risking the design process by making design decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions
                * building relationships with users to support recruitment and ongoing testing

                We took 7 wireframe screen designs into the co-design session as a starting point for discussion. We created these based on the team's face-to-face ideation session the previous week.

                The session was very successful and we learnt a huge amount, particularly around people's current processes for managing training, which are often very manual, and their expectations for a new reimbursement service.

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        ### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test the first iteration of our prototype and the user journey through the service
            * To test some of the terminology used, such as “claim items”, “learners” and “L&D activity”
            * To validate some of our findings from the mini-discovery, particularly around our users' mental models and how they would expect a service like this to operate
        </InsetText>

        During Submitters Round Two - Usability testing we tested **Version 3** of the claims prototype, go to [Iterative evidence-based design, version 3](../../design/iterative-design#version-3) to learn more about this version and what we learnt from testing.

        <InsetText>
            * To test the second iteration of our prototype and the user journey through the service
            * To understand whether changes to the user journey were consistent with users' mental models
        </InsetText>

        During Submitters Round Two - Usability testing we tested **Version 4** of the claims prototype, go to [Iterative evidence-based design, version 4](../../design/iterative-design#version-4) to learn more about this version and what we learnt from testing.

    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        ### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test whether users found an updated version of the prototype more intuitive to use, following prototype revisions
            * To interrogate the new 'claim scaffold' approach ability to add learners onto the system. ​
            * To test the updated ability to add learners onto the system
            * To get feedback on the service name, based on four options
        </InsetText>

        During Submitters Round Two - Usability testing we tested **Version 5** of the claims prototype, go to [Iterative evidence-based design, version 5](../../design/iterative-design#version-5) to learn more about this version and what we learnt from testing.

        ### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To discuss and agree the funding pot names
            * To test the scope information on the opening page
            * To discuss the user understanding of eligibility throughout the pages
            * To explore the "Help" page with video content and when this might be more useful
            * To understand when text-based guidance might be most useful to users
        </InsetText>

        During Submitters Round Two - Usability testing we tested **Version 6** of the claims prototype, go to [Iterative evidence-based design, version 6](../../design/iterative-design#version-6) to learn more about this version and what we learnt from testing.
