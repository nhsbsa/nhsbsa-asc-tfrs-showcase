        ## Research recruitment
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Recognising the significant challenges of workload within the adult social care (ASC) sector, user researchers felt that it may be more difficult to recruit users in this sector than in other careers. User researchers therefore began working on recruitment early on in the Alpha phase in order to identify and recruit users for testing.

        * In total, 44 participants were recruited. Of these, 30 were from the ASC sector, and 14 were from BSA
        * There were 34 individual interviews, one co-design session with five participants, and three workshops with BSA staff featuring between three and five participants each

        The table below shows the recruitment source for each organisation type.

        ### Methods of recruitment

        #### Care providers

        We used the CQC’s online list of care homes to find the names of care homes across the UK. Using these names, we researched a contact form and/or email online for care homes online. In total:

        * 713 care homes were researched
        * 374 of these had valid email addresses
        * 802 emails were sent to these care homes over a period of three months

        #### Stakeholder and advocacy organisations

        We collaborated with many stakeholder and advocacy organisations across the UK to recruit research participants.

        ##### Working with BSA Research Ops

        11 contacts were identified and contacted through the BSA.

        ##### Employer-Led Partnerships

        28 contacts were identified and contacted; three of these contacts forwarded information via local care newsletters.

        ##### Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) contacts

        Colleagues in DHSC shared our research with the following organisations on three occasions.

        ##### Regional Programme Leads
        
        * The Regional Programme Leads (RPLs) shared information about our study with their contacts within each ICS, ensuring that our study was shared within a wide geographical area

        ##### Snowball and personal recruitment

        * After each user research session, all participants were asked whether they could recommend a colleague or friend.
        * We also asked several internal BSA colleagues to test the prototype, based on their experiences in the care sector.
        * We also identified personal contacts of the team in the care sector. A number of BSA and Hippo colleagues also advertised the study on LinkedIn, reaching over 4000 people

        ## Inclusivity and Accessibility
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        ### Inclusivity 
        We sought to maximise inclusivity during the Alpha phase by speaking to a wide range of prospective users as possible. For this reason we spoke to care providers of widely varying sizes, from the very small (~30 employees) to the very large (5000+ employees). 

        We made efforts to speak to organisations providing different types of care, for example residential care homes, domiciliary care providers, and organisations working with individuals with severe learning impairments. We spoke to several local authorities, as well as several care associations (whose members are care providers). Finally, we also conducted research with internal BSA operational staff, our ‘processors’, to ensure we covered all user groups.

        ### Accessibility
        Typically during an Alpha phase options for accessibility testing are limited. We attempted as part of our mini-discovery to recruit users with access needs, however such were the difficulties we encountered with recruitment in the early stages of research that unfortunately this was not possible. 

        We do however have a plan in place for Private Beta to ensure that the service exceeds expectations when it comes to accessibility. This plan includes:

        * Heuristic reviews
        * Usability sessions either with real users with access needs, or with proxy users. Proxy users will come either from internal accessibility groups, or if need be through a dedicated recruitment agency. 
        * Seeking feedback from accessibility experts

            </TableRow>
        </Table>


        ### Submitters Round One - Discovery

        #### Research aims

        To learn more about our users, we conducted semi-structured interviews with participants working in the ASC sector.

        We also conducted a co-design workshop with six additional participants.

        <InsetText>
            * To identify the users in care providers who are most likely to be responsible for completing claims 
            * To find out how care providers provide, pay for and record staff training, and whether this differs by organisation size
            * To find out how care providers manage payments for training, and whether this differs by organisation size 
            * To find out how training provision and attendance may vary according to staff type
            * To find out how actively care staff are involved in managing their own training and CPD
            * To find out how care providers establish that training has been completed
            * To find out whether care provider administrators and carers heard about the training reimbursement scheme
        </InsetText>


        ##### Co-design workshop

        We conducted a co-design workshop with six participants from a national care provider. This allowed to hear a variety of thoughts and opinions in a collaborative setting.

        <InsetText>
            <Details title={'Why we used co-design'}>
                In early alpha we were focussed on understanding the policy space but due to short deadlines and the need to meet ministerial commitments, stakeholders understandably wanted to see quick design outputs. There was a real tension between doing things quickly and doing them properly.

                Several members of the delivery team had experience of co-design, where users are brought into the design process early, before decisions have been made. This is distinct from more standard usability testing, where users are shown an existing prototype to discover how it could be improved.

                Benefits of co-design include:

                * speeding up the creation of an initial prototype
                * de-risking the design process by making design decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions
                * building relationships with users to support recruitment and ongoing testing

                We took 7 wireframe screen designs into the co-design session as a starting point for discussion. We created these based on the team's face-to-face ideation session the previous week.

                The session was very successful and we learnt a huge amount, particularly around people's current processes for managing training, which are often very manual, and their expectations for a new reimbursement service.

            </Details>
        </InsetText>

        ### Submitters Round Two - Usability testing

        #### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test the first iteration of our prototype and the user journey through the service
            * To test some of the terminology used, such as “claim items”, “learners” and “L&D activity”
            * To validate some of our findings from the mini-discovery, particularly around our users' mental models and how they would expect a service like this to operate
        </InsetText>

        ### Submitters Round Three - Usability Testing

        #### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test the second iteration of our prototype and the user journey through the service
            * To understand whether changes to the user journey were consistent with users' mental models
        </InsetText>

        ### Submitters Round Four - Usability Testing

        #### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To test whether users found an updated version of the prototype more intuitive to use, following prototype revisions
            * To interrogate the new 'claim scaffold' approach ability to add learners onto the system. ​
            * To test the updated ability to add learners onto the system
            * To get feedback on the service name, based on four options
        </InsetText>

        ### Submitters Round Five - Usability Testing

        #### Research aims

        <InsetText>
            * To discuss and agree the funding pot names
            * To test the scope information on the opening page
            * To discuss the user understanding of eligibility throughout the pages
            * To explore the "Help" page with video content and when this might be more useful
            * To understand when text-based guidance might be most useful to users
        </InsetText>

        ### Processors Round One - Discovery

        <InsetText>
            * To understand current processes for reimbursement and payments at BSA
            * To identify requirements for creating offline sources of information, including supporting the BSA contact centre
