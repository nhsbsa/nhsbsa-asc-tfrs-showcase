        ## Research recruitment
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        Recognising the significant challenges of workload within the adult social care (ASC) sector, user researchers felt that it may be more difficult to recruit users in this sector than in other careers. User researchers therefore began working on recruitment early on in the Alpha phase in order to identify and recruit users for testing.

        * In total, 44 participants were recruited. Of these, 30 were from the ASC sector, and 14 were from BSA
        * There were 34 individual interviews, one co-design session with five participants, and three workshops with BSA staff featuring between three and five participants each

        The table below shows the recruitment source for each organisation type.

        ### Methods of recruitment

        #### Care providers

        We used the CQC’s online list of care homes to find the names of care homes across the UK. Using these names, we researched a contact form and/or email online for care homes online. In total:

        * 713 care homes were researched
        * 374 of these had valid email addresses
        * 802 emails were sent to these care homes over a period of three months

        #### Stakeholder and advocacy organisations

        We collaborated with many stakeholder and advocacy organisations across the UK to recruit research participants.

        ##### Working with BSA Research Ops

        11 contacts were identified and contacted through the BSA.

        ##### Employer-Led Partnerships

        28 contacts were identified and contacted; three of these contacts forwarded information via local care newsletters.

        ##### Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) contacts

        Colleagues in DHSC shared our research with the following organisations on three occasions.

        ##### Regional Programme Leads
        
        * The Regional Programme Leads (RPLs) shared information about our study with their contacts within each ICS, ensuring that our study was shared within a wide geographical area

        ##### Snowball and personal recruitment

        * After each user research session, all participants were asked whether they could recommend a colleague or friend.
        * We also asked several internal BSA colleagues to test the prototype, based on their experiences in the care sector.
        * We also identified personal contacts of the team in the care sector. A number of BSA and Hippo colleagues also advertised the study on LinkedIn, reaching over 4000 people

        ### Inclusivity 
        We sought to maximise inclusivity during the Alpha phase by speaking to a wide range of prospective users as possible. For this reason we spoke to care providers of widely varying sizes, from the very small (~30 employees) to the very large (5000+ employees). 

        The table below shows where our 44 participants worked, by organisational type and size. Small organisations had between 10-49 employees; medium organisations had 50-249 employees; and large organisations had more than 250 employees.

        We made efforts to speak to organisations providing different types of care, for example residential care homes, domiciliary care providers, and organisations working with individuals with severe learning impairments. We spoke to several local authorities, as well as several care associations (whose members are care providers). Finally, we also conducted research with internal BSA operational staff, our ‘processors’, to ensure we covered all user groups.

        The table below indicates the registered services provided by the 18 care providers that we spoke to.

        ### Accessibility
        Typically during an Alpha phase options for accessibility testing are limited. We attempted as part of our mini-discovery to recruit users with access needs, however such were the difficulties we encountered with recruitment in the early stages of research that unfortunately this was not possible. 

        We do however have a plan in place for Private Beta to ensure that the service exceeds expectations when it comes to accessibility. This plan includes:

        * Heuristic reviews
        * Usability sessions either with real users with access needs, or with proxy users. Proxy users will come either from internal accessibility groups, or if need be through a dedicated recruitment agency. 
        * Seeking feedback from accessibility experts
