        <LeadParagraph>Alongside the blueprints for our main users, there is also some exploratory work around the flow for processing staff (the people who will process a claim after our service) as well as the contact centre process (where our assisted digital support model will work around). We have also documented the other services that are being worked on concurrently with ours.</LeadParagraph>

        ## Services running concurrently and how they may connect
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn width={'full'}>

        Our service sits in the middle of a bunch of others. Itâ€™s tricky to map all of them within the context of if they exist before / during / after our service because the primary users of our service are not the care workers who are using the other services.

        That said, we know which services exist and during beta we will work towards understanding how they connect and how we can link out to others.
