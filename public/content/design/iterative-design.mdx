        We agreed early in alpha to focus predominantly on the part of the service that would be used by people submitting and managing claims. While we have started to think about the related part of the service for internal NHSBSA users, the main design work on this will take place in early beta.
        
        We produced 10 major iterations of the submission prototype. Each of these can be explored from the prototype repository.

        ## Version 3
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        <Tag text="tested" colour="green" />
        The first version tested with users, though it did not include dynamic data so rather than true scenario-based usability testing, users walked through the service and gave their thoughts on each screen within the claim submission journey.

        <Details title={'Specific features of version 3'}>
            * Added the 'start now' and eligibility guidance screens
            * Iterated the claim statuses from 9 down to 5 options
            * Introduced search filters
            * Added workflows for starting claims by either learner or event
        </Details>

        Version 3 was tested in **Submitters Round Two - Usability testing**, go to [Our research approach](../../user-research/research#planning-and-conducting-research) to learn more about our research aims for this round.

        <Details title={'What we learned from testing version 3'}>
            * Many users instinctively compared our service to their experience of the Workforce Development Fund
            * Eligibility is a key concern of users
            * It is important that the language in the service does not reinforce the perception that registered staff are more important than non-registered
            * There was concern around the potential for duplication of claims, especially for learners with the same name
            * No-one had heard of 'targeted upskilling' and the term 'claim items' caused considerable confusion
            * The claim item statuses were well liked and understood
            * The concept of an 'L&D event' was popular, though the terminology was less so
            * The different types of evidence weren't understood, or the reasons they were needed
            * The wording of the button on the check your answers page was confusing as people thought it would add further claims rather than finishing the current one

            ### Using generative AI to create realistic data
            Usability testing of version 3 showed that a lack of realistic data in the prototype was a significant cognitive blocker for users. This unrealistic data comprised:
            - courses 
            - learners
            - claims

            To tackle this we used generative AI.

            We first used it to create a list of fictitious but realistic-looking adult social care training courses.

            We then used it to help write code that could generate random learners and claims data that we could  manipulate in the prototype. Not only did this overcome the cognitive blockers posed by unrealistic data but we can now use these data generators to scale the amount of data in the prototype for different sizes of organisation.

            This provides better flexibility in how we can test with users and also allows us to better visualise how the design scales with varied amount of data.

        ## Version 4
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        <Tag text="tested" colour="green" />
        This was the basis for the second round of user testing. We added large volumes of realistic data on learners, courses and claims to enable true usability testing to take place.
        
        <Details title={'Specific features of version 4'}>
            * Explored terminology around the different funding pots and claims
            * Combined the flows to create a new claim
            * Introduced the GDS 'add a new item' pattern when adding multiple learners to a claim
            * Added confirmation pages and emails
            * Split the 'add evidence' flow from the 'add claim' flow to make it easier to add evidence as a subsequent step to starting a new claim
        </Details>

        Version 4 was tested in **Submitters Round Three - Usability testing**, go to [Our research approach](../../user-research/research#planning-and-conducting-research) to learn more about our research aims for this round.

        <Details title={'What we learned from testing version 4'}>
            * The descriptions of the 2 funding pots were better received (though 'direct care' isn't specific enough as it also relates to nurses and AHPs)
            * Many users incorrectly expected the service to allow them to book the training rather than just claim reimbursement
            * Users are much happier thinking about 'claims' rather than 'claim items'
            * The combined 'start a new claim' flow generally worked well, though many users felt there were some unecessary steps (for instance, having to view course and learner details when adding them)
            * Users were often unclear what the learner ID referred to and whether it related to their internal systems
            * The confirmation emails were seen as helpful
            * The process of adding evidence was confusing as users were unsure what they needed to upload and when
            * In general, as users went through the flow to start a claim they seemed unsure about how far through the process they were, what happens next and whether their progress had been saved

        ## Version 5
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        <Tag text="tested" colour="green" />
        This was used in the third round of user testing and made a number of major design changes.

        <Details title={'Specific features of version 5'}>
            * Made further terminology refinements, for example to clarify that the service cannot be used to book training
            * Introduced a new claim screen to make it much easier for users to see what claim information they'd alredy added and what was incomplete or missing
            * Changed the concept of a claim to relate to a set of learners doing a course on a particular date (rather than a claim only ever being for one learner) which massively shortens the claims list and relates better to users' mental models
            * Got the filters working
            * Added column sorting and dummy pagination links to the 'manage claims' screen
        </Details>

        Version 5 was tested in **Submitters Round Four - Usability testing**, go to [Our research approach](../../user-research/research#planning-and-conducting-research) to learn more about our research aims for this round.

        <Details title={'What we learned from testing version 5'}>
            * The new funding pot names still didn't work well, as participants found it confusing to have registered managers included in the 'non-registered professionals' funding
            * The difference between the 'incomplete' and 'ready to submit' claim statuses was not clear, especially when claims automatically moved to 'ready to submit' when there might be additional learners to add
            * Users thought the 'queried' tab was for claims they had queried, rather than claims queried by NHSBSA
            * Many participants struggled to find the search filters
            * They found it confusing that they could only filter within a status and there was no way to search for a claim across all statuses
            * Feedback on the new claim screen was generally very positive, though a few users thought the use of 'incomplete' tags to indicate missing data was confusing as it made them think the claim had already been started
            * The new claim definition (a single activity with potentially multiple learners) worked well for everyone
            * The role groups when adding a new learner need further investigation as some participants felt they were not mutually exclusive
            * Not everyone spotted the notes field when adding a claim and if they did they weren't sure what it was for

        ## Version 6
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        <Tag text="tested" colour="green" />
        This was put together to support the final round of user testing, which focused on content and wording.

        <Details title={'Specific features of version 6'}>
            * Added the recommended service name
            * Created 2 separate versions of the start page to allow us to get feedback on what to name the funding pots
            * Iterated the eligibility pages
            * Introduced a new help page around starting a new claim, which both video and text content
        </Details>

        Version 6 was tested in **Submitters Round Four - Usability testing**, go to [Our research approach](../../user-research/research#planning-and-conducting-research) to learn more about our research aims for this round.

        <Details title={'What we learned from testing version 6'}>
            * Users preferred version A of the start page ('care skills' and 'revalidation' funding)
            * We could improve the wording to clarify that booking training is outside the scope of the service
            * Eligibility information is generally clear
            * The help content when starting a new claim is much appreciated and some users may prefer the video or text content
            * Similar help content around evidence requirements would also be useful
            * The declaration text was clear, though users wanted a link to the grant award letter and also to potentially see more information about the types of checks that will be carried out
        </Details>

        ## Version 7
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        <Tag text="to be tested" colour="yellow" />
        This version brought together all the findings from alpha into a final prototype covering the claim submission and management user journeys. It has not yet been tested with users.


        <Details title={'Specific features of version 7'}>
            * Used the preferred funding pot names on the start page and throughout
            * Added a new dashboard screen after sign in to indicate how we could show live data about an organisation's claims, and to present the 3 main user options (eligibility checker, manage care skills claims, manage revalidation claims)
            * Replaced the filters on each tab with a cross-status search function
            * Shortened the table headings (for example, changing 'claim reference number' to just 'claim reference')
            * Changed the claim details page to bring it in line with the GDS check answers pattern and removed the incomplete tags
            * Changed how learners were displayed to remove the summary card component
            * Removed the 'cost per learner' field and added the 'payment date' field to indicate when the employer paid for the training
            * Introduced the new 'maximum reimbursable amount per learner' element in the top right of the claim details screen (on approval this changes to show actual reimbursed amount)
            * Added the claim history timeline component for submitted claims
            * Added the manage and start claim screens for revalidation (CPD) funding
            * Started to consider the implications of split claims, where 60% of the reimbursement is provided upfront and 40% on completion
        </Details>

        Version 7 will be tested in early beta.
