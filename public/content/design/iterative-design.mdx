        We agreed early in alpha to focus predominantly on the part of the service that would be used by people submitting and managing claims. While we have started to think about the related part of the service for internal NHSBSA users, the main design work on this will take place in early beta.
        
        We produced 10 major iterations of the submission prototype. Each of these can be explored from the prototype repository.

        ## Version 1
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        This was an internal prototype we used to explore possible data groupings and approaches to represent and manage claims.

        ## Version 2
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        Another internal prototype where we started to look at how claims would progress through the system and the statuses we'd need within the service.

        ## Version 3
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        The first version tested with users, though it did not include dynamic data so rather than true scenario-based usability testing, users walked through the service and gave their thoughts on each screen within the claim submission journey.

        <Details title={'Specific features of version 3'}>
            * Added the 'start now' and eligibility guidance screens
            * Iterated the claim statuses from 9 down to 5 options
            * Introduced search filters
            * Added workflows for starting claims by either learner or event

            ### Using generateive AI to create realistic data
            One of our takeaways from testing version 3 with users was how much of a cognitive blocker a lack of realistic data in the prototype caused. This unrealistic data could be categorised into three groups:
            - Courses
            - Learners
            - Claims
            
            To tackle this we used generative AI to help in the number of ways. Firstly we used it to create a list of fictitious but realistic looking adult social care training courses. The we used it help write code that could generate random learners and claims data that we could then manipulate in the prototype. Not only did this overcome the cognitive blockers posed by unrealistic data but we can now use these data generators to scale the amount of data in prototype for different sizes of organisation. Not only does this provide better flexibility in how we can test with users but also allows us to better visualise how the designs scales with varied amount of data.

        ## Version 4
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        This was the basis for the second round of user testing. We added large volumes of realistic data on learners, courses and claims to enable true usability testing to take place.
        
        <Details title={'Specific features of version 4'}>
            * Explored terminology around the different funding pots and claims
            * Combined the flows to create a new claim
            * Introduced the GDS 'add a new item' pattern when adding multiple learners to a claim
            * Added confirmation pages and emails
            * Split the 'add evidence' flow from the 'add claim' flow to make it easier to add evidence as a subsequent step to starting a new claim

        ## Version 5
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        This was used in the third round of user testing and made a number of major design changes.

        <Details title={'Specific features of version 5'}>
            * Made further terminology refinements, for example to clarify that the service cannot be used to book training
            * Introduced a new claim screen to make it much easier for users to see what claim information they'd alredy added and what was incomplete or missing
            * Changed the concept of a claim to relate to a set of learners doing a course on a particular date (rather than a claim only ever being for one learner) which massively shortens the claims list and relates better to users' mental models
            * Got the filters working
            * Added column sorting and dummy pagination links to the 'manage claims' screen
        </Details>
    </GridColumn>

<GridRow>

    <GridColumn width={'full'}>
        ## Version 6
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        This was put together to support the final round of user testing, which focused on content and wording.

        <Details title={'Specific features of version 6'}>
            * Added the recommended service name
            * Created 2 separate versions of the start page to allow us to get feedback on what to name the funding pots
            * Iterated the eligibility pages
            * Introduced a new help page around starting a new claim, which both video and text content
        </Details>
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'full'}>
        ## Version 7
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        This version brought together all the findings from alpha into a final prototype covering the claim submission and management user journeys. It has not yet been tested with users.


        <Details title={'Specific features of version 7'}>
            * Added the agreed funding pot names
            * Introduced an initial version of a dashboard screen to route users to the different options available to them and provide a summary of claims within the service
            * Made final iterations to the claim statuses (removing the 'ready to submit' status and introducing the 'approved' status)
            * Improved the claim screen by making the design more consistent with the GDS 'check answers' pattern, making it easier to add evidence, simplifying the cost requirements and adding a payment date field
            * Replaced the claim filters with a global search and added a new advanced search screen
            * Added the start and manage claim screens for CPD claims
            * Started to consider the implications of split claims, where 60% of the reimbursement is provided upfront and 40% on completion
