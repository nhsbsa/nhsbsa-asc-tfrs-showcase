        <LeadParagraph>We know that making the service simple to use means that users should need as little help as possible. We realised early on, however, that for a service based on a complicated policy, there was likely to be a need for at least guidance to help users.</LeadParagraph>

        ## Overview
    </GridColumn>
    <GridColumn width={'2/3'}>
        For services like this one which are aimed at professionals, rather than members of the public, we felt that there was more likely to be an expectation of help content. For users who need to use the service to do their job, we felt they woiuld be willing to put aside a small amount of time to ensure they understood what they were doing, as it’s in their interests to submit claims that are completed accurated and can be reimbursed speedily.

        We therefore focused on:
        - setting realistic expectations for the service through the start page
        - providing a clear description around eligibility
        - the potential need for contextual help while using the service
        - whether we could provide support for ‘first time’ use of certain functions

        All rounds of usability testing touched on these issues to some extend. We also did a content ‘deep dive’ at the end of alpha to explore these issues in more detail. Overall we were pleased that users highlighted that the language used throughout the service was clear and easy to understand, saying “it’s free from jargon”, “not too fussy” and that “all the info is relevant”.

        Early rounds of usability testing highlighted that many users thought they’d be easy to use the service to book training, as well as getting reimbursement, when this isn’t the case. We therefore used added a simple process flow list at the top of the page to explain how the service fits into the end-to-end process for managing training.

        ## Eligibility
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        One way in which we can help users is by ensuring that the rules around eligibility - of activities and learners - are clear and unambiguous. We know that many users will be used to the WDF and therefore the differences between that and TFRS could cause confusion.

        We have been testing a specific guidance page - the eligibility checker - which would be available before logging into the service to allow users to explore eligibility. This has tested well so far, though there are some additional bits of information, such as around VAT and the learner cap for revalidation claims - that we can further improve in beta.

        ## Contextual help
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        In general, it’s better to provide guidance to users at the point in the flow where they need it - rather than up front (which they could then forget). We’re therefore aware of the importance of the micro content on each screen, as well as the potential for signposting to more detailed guidance where this might be necessary.

        ## First time support

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        We created this new screen, which users would be asked if they wanted to see the first time they create a claim, in response to findings from early rounds of testing. We heard very strongly that once users had created their first claim - and understand the terminology and its constuent parts - they had no problem with further claims. But the first time did cause anxiety, while they aligned their mental model of what a claim is to how the service works.

        The new screen contains guidance in 2 formats - short video and text - to cater to people with different learning styles. Feedback was really positive and this is something we’ll continue to iterate in early beta. We’ll also explore the possibility of creating similar guidance around the different types of evidence required in a claim, as this was the other area which users said they’d appreciate help with. 

        If someone chooses not to look at this screen when prompted the first time, they wouldn’t be asked again but would still be able to access it from the link under ‘related content’.
