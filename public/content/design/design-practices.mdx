        At each stage of the design process, we used research findings to develop new hypotheses to test and to determine whether previous hypotheses could be validated or not. These are all documented in our design log.

        All design decisions have been based on user needs, though where necessary we have also been mindful of business needs, such as those around the processing of claims.

        The whole team was involved in design ideation discussions, though detailed design work was carried out in partnership between the interaction and content designers on the team. This was done in face to face sessions, which maximised opportunities for collaboration and multidisciplinary design synergies.

        We agreed with DHSC early on that we would use the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), though where necessary we also explored components and patterns from related departmental design systems (such as MOJ and HMRC).

        We have identified a new use case for the GDS 'check answers' pattern. We plan to continue exploring this in beta and if it proves to be successful we will share our evidence with the wider government design community.

        Figures from the [National Literacy Trust](https://literacytrust.org.uk/parents-and-families/adult-literacy/what-do-adult-literacy-levels-mean/) show that 1 in 7 adults in England have literacy skills at or below entry level 3, which is the expected level of a 9 to 11 year old child. It’s possible that literacy skills could be even lower across the ASC sector as a whole, as care jobs can be appealing to people who are more practically-minded and leave school with fewer formal qualifications.

        In theory, everyone working in ASC requires core skills including in English and digital literacy. A certain level of literacy would be required to pass the Level 2 Care Certificate, which should be part of everyone’s induction prgrammes when they join the care profession. The [NHSX Adult Social Care Technology and Digital Skills Review](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2021-12/NHSX_Technology_and_Digital_Skills_Review_Main_Report_November_2021.pdf) from 2021 found that low literacy and language skills can be barriers to using technology at work, however.

        The Government Digital Service recommends writing for a reading age of 9, though there is some flexibility in this for services which are designed for professional users rather than members of the public. In general, though, everyone benefits from plain English and from content which is easy to read and requires less cognitive load to process.

        Simple language is also better for people who are neurodiverse. For example, autistic people can struggle to understand non-literal language.

        In all our content we have:
        - avoided jargon and metaphors
        - explained acronyms on first use
        - kept sentences and paragraphs short
        - used headings and bullet points to break up text

        We have already carried out research with participants to specifically look at terminology and content. We’ll continue to focus on this as we move into beta to ensure that all our content remains as easy to understand as possible as we iterate the prototype. Feedback from participants has praised the lack of jargon and ease of understanding of our content. We plan to test our content using automated tools to look for where we can make further improvements.
