        At each stage of the design process, we used research findings to develop new hypotheses to test and to determine whether previous hypotheses could be validated or not. These are all documented in our design log.

        All design decisions have been based on user needs, though where necessary we have also been mindful of business needs, such as those around the processing of claims.

        The whole team was involved in design ideation discussions, though detailed design work was carried out in partnership between the interaction and content designers on the team. This was done in face to face sessions, which maximised opportunities for collaboration and multidisciplinary design synergies.

        We agreed with DHSC early on that we would use the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), though where necessary we also explored components and patterns from related departmental design systems (such as MOJ and HMRC).

        We have identified a new use case for the GDS 'check answers' pattern. We plan to continue exploring this in beta and if it proves to be successful we will share our evidence with the wider government design community.
