        ## What a claim is
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        We realised early in alpha that it would be important to define exactly what constitutes a claim as part of this service. We knew a claim could be made up of a combination of activities (such a course on a specific date) and learners (who attended the course). But we weren't sure how wide a claim should be. Would users want to submit multiple activities and learners in a single claim?

        We decided to start with the finest granularity we could and see what users made of this. This would be a single learner associated with a single activity. We called this a 'claim item' as we hypothesised that users would expect to combine multiple claim items into a single 'claim', which they would submit to NHSBSA on a periodic basis.

        So if a particular course was attended by 5 learners, this would equate to 5 claim items.

        We tested this approach in version 3 of the prototype. We found that users had no problem with the concept of 'claims' but were confused by a 'claim item' and found it hard to guess what this might be. In version 4 we dropped the 'items' and just called these activity/learner pairings 'claims'. This seemed somewhat better for users but their expectation was generally that claims should be based around activities. And the individual activity/learner pairings made the list of claims very long and unwieldy.

        So in version 5 we changed our concept of a claim to relate to any number of learners associated with a specific activity (on the same date). This considerably shortened the list of claims in each status and fitted much better with users' mental models.

        ## Mental scaffolding
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        In early versions of the prototype we had a ‘one question per screen’ approach to the start a new claim flow, allowing users to build up the information that made up a claim.

        What we found, however, was that while each individual question within the flow was understood by users, many of them were confused by where they were in the process and how much of a claim they had already completed or had left to fill in. They also wanted flexibility in terms of the order in which they entered information.

        In version 5 we therefore created a new claim screen, which we hypothesised would provide the ‘mental scaffolding’ to enable users to visualise a claim before they started filled in the information and to understood their progress.

        We explored 2 options for this during our design ideation phase for this sprint: the task list component and a variant of the check your answers pattern for missing information. After discussion we felt that the task list component didn’t meet our users needs because:
        - users could be completing the claim over multiple sessions before submitting
        - it couldn’t show users their answers if they returned to the claim, slowing down how quickly they could pick it up again to complete

        So we instead opted to use a slightly adapted version of the GDS ‘check answers’ pattern using the summary list missing information component. This would allow users to see the list of items before they’d added their ‘answers’ and use it as a checklist to enable them to add the information in whatever order they wished.

        This worked really well in general, though users still found a few things slightly confusing. For example, we used ‘incomplete’ tags to indicate where information had not yet been added (which we drew from the task list component). But some users thought this meant that the claim had already been started. There was also some confusion with the overall claim status of ‘incomplete’.

        We had also used the summary card component for the learners section. Each card included links for adding any evidence relating to that learner. For claims with lots of learners, however, this made the screen very long and users found itvisually overwhelming. We found that users were also overlooking the need to add evidence.

        In version 7 we iterated this screen to bring the pattern back in line with the GDS check answers pattern with missing information and remove the ‘incomplete’ tags. We also separated out the evidence of completion to it’s own section.  We expect this to test well in early beta but can further fine tune it if necessary.

        ## Explaining the types of funding
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        The scheme policy describes 2 types of funding that will be available through the reimbursement service. One of the content design challenges was to find an appropriate way to describe these 'funding pots'.

        The DHSC service commission used the terms 'targeted upskilling' for the primary pot and 'Continuing Professional Development' for the other. We suspected these would not be terms that users would naturally understand or find useful but felt they were the best place to start in version 3. We then explored alternative terminology in versions 4 and 5, as shown in the table below.

        <Table>
            <TableHeader>
                <TableCell width="20%">Prototype</TableCell>
                <TableCell width="40%">Primary funding pot</TableCell>

                <TableCell>
                    Version 3
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    Targeted upskilling
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    Continuing Professional Development
                </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>
                    Version 4
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    Direct care
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    Professional revalidation
                </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>
                    Version 5
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    Non-registered professionals
                </TableCell>
                <TableCell>
                    Registered professionals
                </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
        </Table>

        Up to version 5, none of the wording went down well with all the users we tested it with.

        'Targeted upskilling' felt like a meaningless piece of jargon and while 'Continuing Professional Development' was understood by many (though not all) users, it was often used very generically so was not specific enough to differentiate between the pots.

        'Direct care' was a well understood and used term but again was not specific enough, as it also covered the staff eligible for the secondary funding pot. 'Professional revalidation' felt like a better and more specific way to described the secondary pot and while not everyone had heard the term, they understood it when they read the description.

        When we tested 'non-registered professionals' against 'registered professionals', the big problem was that the primary funding pot also covers registered managers. Though they're only a small group, users told us it didn't feel appropriate that registered professionals were included under the 'non-registered' heading.

        We therefore decided to carry out one final small round of testing at the end of alpha and present 2 options for the funding pot names to users, based on everything we'd learnt so far. We created these alternative start pages in version 6 of the prototype.

        Option A used 'Care skills funding' for the primary pot, which as an arbitrary name we could define as appropriate. 'Revalidation funding' was used for the secondary pot, a form of the name that had already tested positively.

        Option B used a slightly different approach by splitting the funding into 3 pots rather than 2. This allowed us to define the eligible users more precisely. We called the pots 'Non-registered direct care professionals', 'Registered managers' and 'Registered direct care professionals'.

        Findings from research indicated that participants had a strong preference for option A. This was because:
        
        * as 2 of the categories in version B were treated the same way it was unnecessary to split them, as long as it was clear which pot registered managers fall into
        * they didn't like the focus on 'non-registered' in the headings of version B, as they thought this sent the wrong message in terms of the status of these staff
        * the terms 'care skills funding' and 'revalidation funding' were clear and their descriptions unambiguous
        
        We therefore decided to use these terms in our final alpha prototype (version 7).

        ## Tension between simplicity and flexibility
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        There is always a trade off in design between making things as simple as possible for a user but also ensuring the service is flexible enough to support different expectations and ways of working. We have been aware of this throughout the process of iterating the prototype.

        For example, we considered what should happen if a training course was covered by more than one invoice. For instance, an employer might pay for several members of staff to attend some training and then subsequently pay separately for some additional colleagues.

        In this case, the most flexible approach would be to allow separate evidence of payment to be uploaded against each learner within a claim. But this also makes the process of constructing a claim more complicated. Following usability testing, the approach we have ended up with in version 6 of the prototype is to say that each claim must relate to a single invoice. This simplifies the design of the claim screen by only requiring a single piece of payment evidence to be uploaded. It does mean, however, that in the case of multiple invoices for a single activity, several claims would need to be submitted.

        This feels like a reasonable approach but is something we will continue to explore - with both end users and NHSBSA users - in early beta.

        ## Claim statuses
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        Fundemental to the management of claims is the ability to track them through the end-to-end process. We realised early in alpha this woiuld require a set of clear and unambiguous claim statuses. We have iterated these over the course of alpha, starting with 9 options (version a in the table below) and ending alpha with 5 (version c). Based on usability testing, these final statuses are well understood by users.

            <TableHeader>
                <TableCell>Version a</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Version b</TableCell>

                <TableCell></TableCell>
                <TableCell>Approved</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>Rejected</TableCell>
                <TableCell></TableCell>
                <TableCell></TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>Queried</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Insufficient evidence</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Queried by NHSBSA</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
            <TableRow>
                <TableCell>Paid</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Paid</TableCell>
                <TableCell>Paid</TableCell>
            </TableRow>
        </Table>

        Our thinking around the statuses was driven by the need for them to be understood by users without needing explanation. The use of tabs on the manage claims screen, which users liked as they could see their claims moving from left to right through the process, also meant that we were limited by the amount of space on the screen.

        Insights around the 'ready to submit' status were particularly interesting. While users understood this status (representing those claims which had no missing information and were therefore ready to be submitted for processing) and felt it was useful, it did not work in practice. What we found in usability testing of version 5 of the prototype was that users were confused about when claims moved from the 'incomplete' to the 'ready to submit' status, especially as it might look as if a claim was complete when actually more learners were due to be added. This could lead to claims being submitted prematurely.
