    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        We began this project by ensuring we had all the roles and skillsets required to deliver the service.

        This includes Product, Delivery, User Research, Interaction Design, Service Design, Content Design, Technical Architecture, Business Analysis, and Service Delivery all working collaboratively together.

        Unfortunately our product owner (PO) left the project very early on and NHSBSA was unable to replace them during alpha due to the lead time for recruitment. Other NHSBSA team members stepped up in terms of taking on some of the roles of a PO, though we would clearly have benefitted from the leadership and direction that a PO would have brought us. This gap will be filled by the time we start beta.

        We also had to overcome some hurdles in onboarding a new solution architect to the team after our original team member was signed off ill mid-way through Alpha and could not return to the project.

        As well as having our core multidisciplinary team in place we have also worked extremely closely with others teams and organisations over the past few months.

        These include:

        * Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)
        * Fraud prevention 
        * ResOps
        * Service interaction & design
        * Skills for Care (SfC)
        * Contact Centre Services

        ## Ways of working
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        As a team, we have been working in an agile way with regular ceremonies in place to ensure we're working towards the same goals and ensuring there are multiple and frequent opportunities for communication and collaboration.

        Our ceremonies have included:

        * Daily stand-ups to check in on progress and identify any blockers
        * Fortnightly sprint planning to align on work and priorities for the next 2 weeks
        * Fortnightly show & tell to reflect on work completed and share this with stakeholders.
        * Fortnightly retrospective to ensure continuous improvement and reflect on the past sprint.
        * Fortnightly mid-sprint open-house playbacks
        * Weekly checkpoints with DHSC heads of service and policy

        ## Transferring and sharing knowledge
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        As a rainbow team with a mixture of NHSBSA members and contractors it’s been important that we share and document our work and findings. This will help when new members join the team, as well as looking towards the future of the business as usual running of the service. 

        To facilitate this knowledge share:

            * the service delivery manager who will be running the live service has been part of the project team and included in all the team events
            * we sent open invites to our fortnightly sprint show and tells to other parts of NHSBSA and recorded these sessions for people who couldn't attend
            * we’ve had meetings and sign-off with NHSBSA professional leads to align with technical approaches 
            * all UR, design and technical findings and reports are documented and stored on NHSBSA SharePoint and Confluence

        We have also connected with other NHSBSA and DHSC project teams. This has helped us to understand how our service may interact with theirs. It also reduces duplication of effort by re-using other team’s work and allowing them to benefit from work we have already done.

                #### Digitising Social Care 

                The [Digitising Social Care](https://beta.digitisingsocialcare.co.uk/) website is a new service to support social care providers to go digital. It’s also the first use of the ‘CARE’ branding and as such we were interested in their approach. We reached out to their policy lead in DHSC and programme manager in NHSX. They shared with us the outputs for the work from discovery to beta. We’ve also been inviting them to our show and tells to keep the conversation going.

                #### ASC strategy work

                DHSC commissioned Servita to look at the wider strategy across the various services that are currently in development in the ASC space. We’ve been in touch to understand how this could support our work and we’ve shared outputs from our show and tells with them.

                #### Care workforce pathway

                This work is also being led by Hippo, the aim being to make it easy for staff in social care to understand the skills they should have and how to progress their careers. We have regular discussions to share  the work we are doing and identify cross over points.

                #### Digital Skills Qualification and Digital Passport for Skills

                The digital skills passport will provide an ongoing record of someone’s skills and achievements. There could obviously be an important role for our service to play in populating this record. We have reached out to the DHSC team to understand where the services sit in the broader landscape and how they might interact.

        ## Bridging the digital/face-to-face divide
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>

        As a geographically diverse team, working remotely has obviously been our default position. But we knew from experience that regular co-location can be really important in building the team and facilitating a culture of trust, multi-disciplinary working and effective ideation.

        Where possible, the whole team, or parts of it, have come together for face-to-face sessions. We prioritised these when we had artefacts to produce, or things to discuss, which would particularly benefit from this approach.

        For instance, many team members got together in Leeds at the end of October for a design ideation day. Up until then we had been exploring and understanding the policy space. This was the first time we had started thinking about the design of the service itself and we felt this would be most effective face-to-face. Our aim was to allow us to produce an initial set of wireframes to support a co-design session with users the following week.

        During the session we:

        * analysed our riskiest assumptions to identify the main themes
        * generated 'how might we' statements around these themes
        * ideated possible design solutions to these statements
        * identified 4 design principles to guide our ongoing design thinking

        <GridRow>
            <GridColumn width={'1/2'}>
                <ZoomImage alt="The research and design team in Leeds." small={'../../images/wow-leeds-ideation-thumb.png'} medium={'../../images/wow-leeds-ideation.png'} />
            </GridColumn>

            </GridColumn>
        </GridRow>

        The 4 design principles we identified were:

        * supporting users to get it right first time
        * flexibility in ways of working
        * an accessible and inclusive service
        * minimising time spent claiming

        These have proved to be invaluble in guiding us as we developed and iterated our alpha prototype.

        We have kept the face-to-face sessions going during prototype iteration. After each UR playback, the whole team has got together virtually to agree the main design areas to address in the next iteration. The UX and content designers then spent a day together - alternating between Leeds and Manchester - to ideate on how to address each of these areas and produce wireframes. The UX designer then took the wireframes and made the changes for the next version of the prototype.
