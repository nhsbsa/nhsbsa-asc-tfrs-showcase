        We began this project by ensuring we had all the roles and skillsets required to deliver the service.

        This includes Product, Delivery, User Research, Interaction Design, Service Design, Content Design, Technical Architecture, Business Analysis, and Service Delivery all working collaboratively together.

        We also had to overcome some hurdles in onboarding a new solution architect to the team after our original team member was signed off ill mid-way through Alpha and could not return to the project, along with onboarding a new delivery lead after our original team member was rolled off the project.

        As well as having our core multidisciplinary team in place we have also worked extremely closely with others teams and organisations over the past few months.

        These include:

        * Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)
        * Fraud prevention 
        * ResOps
        * Service interaction & design
        * Skills for Care (SfC)
        * Contact Centre Services

        As a team, we have been working in an agile way with regular ceremonies in place to ensure we're working towards the same goals and ensuring there are multiple and frequent opportunities for communication and collaboration.

        Our ceremonies have included:

        * Daily stand-ups to check in on progress and identify any blockers
        * Fortnightly sprint planning to align on work and priorities for the next 2 weeks
        * Fortnightly show & tell to reflect on work completed and share this with stakeholders.
        * Fortnightly retrospective to ensure continuous improvement and reflect on the past sprint.
        * Fortnightly mid-sprint open-house playbacks
        * Weekly checkpoints with DHSC heads of service and policy

        As a geographically diverse team, working remotely has obviously been our default position. But we knew from experience that regular co-location can be really important in building the team and facilitating a culture of trust, multi-disciplinary working and effective ideation.

        Where possible, the whole team, or parts of it, have come together for face-to-face sessions. We prioritised these when we had artefacts to produce, or things to discuss, which would particularly benefit from this approach.

        For instance, many team members got together in Leeds at the end of October for a design ideation day. Up until then we had been exploring and understanding the policy space. This was the first time we had started thinking about the design of the service itself and we felt this would be most effective face-to-face. Our aim was to allow us to produce an initial set of wireframes to support a co-design session with users the following week.

        During the session we:

        * analysed our riskiest assumptions to identify the main themes
        * generated 'how might we' statements around these themes
        * ideated possible design solutions to these statements
        * identified 4 design principles to guide our ongoing design thinking

        <GridRow>
            <GridColumn width={'1/2'}>
                <ZoomImage alt="The research and design team in Leeds." small={'../../images/wow-leeds-ideation-thumb.png'} medium={'../../images/wow-leeds-ideation.png'} />

            </GridColumn>
        </GridRow>

        The 4 design principles we identified were:

        * supporting users to get it right first time
        * flexibility in ways of working
        * an accessible and inclusive service
        * minimising time spent claiming

        These have proved to be invaluble in guiding us as we developed and iterated our alpha prototype.

        We have kept the face-to-face sessions going during prototype iteration. After each UR playback, the whole team has got together virtually to agree the main design areas to address in the next iteration. The UX and content designers then spent a day together - alternating between Leeds and Manchester - to ideate on how to address each of these areas and produce wireframes. The UX designer then took the wireframes and made the changes for the next version of the prototype.
