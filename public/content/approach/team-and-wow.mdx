        We began this project by ensuring we had all the roles and skillsets required to deliver the service.

        This includes Product, Delivery, User Research, Interaction Design, Service Design, Content Design, Technical Architecture, Business Analysis, and Service Delivery all working collaboratively together.

        We also had to overcome some hurdles in onboarding a new solution architect to the team after our original team member was signed off ill mid-way through Alpha and could not return to the project, along with onboarding a new delivery lead after our original team member was rolled off the project.

        As a team, we have been working in an agile way with regular ceremonies in place to ensure we're working towards the same goals and ensuring there are multiple and frequent opportunities for communication and collaboration.

        Our ceremonies have included:

        * Daily stand-ups to check in on progress and identify any blockers
        * Fortnightly sprint planning to align on work and priorities for the next 2 weeks
        * Fortnightly show & tell to reflect on work completed and share this with stakeholders.
        * Fortnightly retrospective to ensure continuous improvement and reflect on the past sprint.
        * Fortnightly mid-sprint open-house playbacks
        * Weekly checkpoints with DHSC heads of service and policy
