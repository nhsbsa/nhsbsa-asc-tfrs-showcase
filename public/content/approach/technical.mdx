        The key objectives of the technical team during Alpha has been:
            - Identify and understand potential integrations and re-use
            - Identify technical complexity and constraints and assist with policy/product decisions
            - Ensure a product design and a full service architecture that will be reliable and secure

        ### Standard and principles

        The service will follow internal NHSBSA, wider government and industry led standards throughout.

        ### 9. Create a secure service which protects users’ privacy

        #### NCSC Cloud Security Principles
        - External Interface Protection using WAF’s, DoS Protection, and Proxies.
        - Protect Users Personal Identifiable Information with Encryption as Standard in Transit and at Rest at all times.
        - Protect Assets using Defense in Depth using Security Groups and Subnets.
        - Secure Operation User Management with Identity Access Management and Audited Access.
        - Understanding Our Suppliers Risks with Supplier Security Management.
        - Always being on guard to new Threats with Continuous Threat Detection and Management.
        - Supply Chain Vulnerability management including CVE container image scanning in GiLab

        #### Identity Access Management (including authentication)
        - Authentication of the claim service with be provided by Azure Active Directory B2C. 
        - Authentication of the processing and customer contact centre service will be provided by Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra)
        - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), will be required for both the internal and external services. 

        #### Regular IT Health-checks
        - External IT Health-checks will be conducted before going live and annually thereafter. Adhoc health checks will also be conducted  following significant service changes.

        ### 12. Make new source code open
        We will conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment of the code in compliance with the well-established NHSBSA Open-Source policy before making any repositories available publicly.

        We are will take the following steps to ensure any public code can be hosted on the NHSBSA Gitlab instance:

        - Scanning existing repositories to detect any potential data leaks.
        - Implementing GitLeaks as a pre-commit hook to prevent the accidental inclusion of secrets in our commits.
        - Documented process to address and remediating vulnerabilities found within the codebase.

        The risk assessment will take into account the integration with the NHSBSA Finance product Integra.

         ### 13. Use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns

        #### Technology considerations
        - Hosted by Amazon Web Services (Public Cloud First Policy)
        - Builds to provide end-to-end, seamless and integrated Digital Service (GDS Design Principle of Designing Services Not Websites)
        - Internet-facing accessible web portal to View/Submit/Edit MCCD (GDS Principle of This is for Everyone)
        - Asynchronous services (AWS Well-Architected – Performance Pillar and NHS Technology Standard of enabling infrastructure that supports technical evolution, financial investment and resilience)
        - Implement in Node.js using Open-Source components (GDS Principle of Make Things Open)
        - Reuse existing services (Leveraged NHSBSA Common components where appropriate)
            - NHSBSA File Service
            - NHSBSA Finance Service
            - NHSBSA Workflow manager

        #### Open-source design
        Prototype code files are all stored on the NHSBSA GitHub space

        ### 14. Operate a reliable service

        #### Quality Assurance
        The focus of the Alpha was shifting assurance/governance left and producing a service architecture that was readily testable. During Beta, a test lead and automated testers will be embedded in the team from initial development. The following will be carried out:
        - Automated Testing (Cucumber Serenity)
            - Functional Testing
            - Integration Testing
            - Regression Testing
        - Manual Testing
            - Exploratory Testing
            - Usability Testing
            - Smoke testing with predefined test cases
        - Performance Testing (JMeter)
            - Bottleneck Identification
            - Scalability Assessment
            - Capacity Planning
            - Load and stress testing
        - External Assurance
            - DAC Accessibility Audit
            - IT Health Check

        #### High availability and fault tolerant service
        We will do the following to make sure our service is both highly available and fault-tolerant:
        - **Utilise AWS Cloud Services**: We have leveraged AWS's high availability and fault-tolerant infrastructure to ensure that our service is always available to our users.
        - **Use Multiple AZs**: We have deployed our resources across multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. This ensures that if one or more AZs experience downtime, our services will remain available.
        - **Data Backup**: We will also have backup strategies in place to ensure that data is protected, and we can quickly restore our services in the event of data loss.

        #### Disaster Recovery
        Disaster Recovery process and database restoration will be automated, documented and tested regularly. 

        #### Observability and monitoring
        We will use Datadog and AWS CloudWatch to monitor our resources and detect anomalies before they become major issues. We will set up notifications to alert us of potential issues so that we can act before they impact our services.
