        The key objectives of the technical team during Alpha has been:
            - Identify and understand potential integrations and re-use
            - Identify technical complexity and constraints and assist with policy/product decisions
            - Ensure a product design and a full service architecture that will be reliable and secure

        ## Authentication
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        Authentication for NHSBSA caseworkers and call centre staff will be provided by Microsoft Entra ID, which is a well establish within NHSBSA.

        Authentication and Identity Access Management (IAM) for ASC Organisation staff consists of 2 main challenges:
        - Chosen Technology and management of users
        - Consistent branding and journey for users - i.e. making users login with different means

        We have chosen [Azure B2C](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview") for the ASC Organisation users. Azure B2C is an approved technology within NHSBSA for similar use-cases. Analysis show that it can meet functional & non-functional requirements of the service.

        There is a risk that multiple login mechanisms exist within the Adult Social Care sector. We have suggested that a piece of work to look at the strategic IAM and Account mechanism within the sector.

        ## Handling of approved courses
    </GridColumn>

    <GridColumn width={'3/4'}>
        DHSC have planned for a separate team to manage the details of approved Targeted Up-skilling Courses. It is envisioned that this will be managed centrally and accessed via a versioned API. However, the initial MVP solution will involve the TFRS service storing a version of that file and handling change management. A suitable data model and change management approach is being agreed.
