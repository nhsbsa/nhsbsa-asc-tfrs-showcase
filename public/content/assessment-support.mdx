                    - Discovery was broad, thorough and helpful​
                    - We’ve built on this to focus in on the problem we're here to solve

                    ### Riskiest assumptions

                    The assumptions fell into 3 core areas around:
                    - policy
                    - governance
                    - user behaviour

        ## ASC digital landscape

        Our service sits in the middle of a bunch of others. It’s tricky to map all of them within the context of if they exist before / during / after our service because the primary users of our service are not the care workers who are using the other services.

        That said, we know which services exist and during beta we will work towards understanding how they connect and how we can link out to others.
